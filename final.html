			<h3>Night life</h3>
			<p>Miami has everything from trendy low-lit lounges and open-air Latin-themed bars to high-end, designer decorated spaces. 
Every area in Miami has bars and lounges that stand out in their own right. You won’t have to look very hard to find a nice place for a happy hour or late night cocktail. 
If you’re staying in a hotel, there’s probably a watering hole right in your lobby. If there’s not, ask the concierge for recommendations on places to try. Let them know what you’re looking for—live music, haute-mixology or a sports bar to watch the game
